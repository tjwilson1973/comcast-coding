Ad Server that responds to GET and POST requests

This progam is a simple ad server which responds to GET and POST requests using the HTTP protocol. It is implemented in perl and can run from command line in any directory on a linux-based OS with the simple invocation: user@host-machine:~/ perl ./ad-server.pl

The directory where it is installed is the server's document root. The server responds to GET and POST requests from curl, browsers and simple http clients like telnet or the Mozilla Firefox Poster tool.

The server can be reached with a browser by calling: "http://<host>:<port>/PARTNER_ID" (to list all ads by a partner) or "http://<host>:<port>/" (to list all ads by all partners in json).

Post requests can be made with telnet or the Firefox poster tool.

Here is a sample request using curl:

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' --data-binary @test.json http://<server>:80/

If the port is not given, it is defaulted to 80.
